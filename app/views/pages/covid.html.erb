  <h2>Is Pawlett Plumbing and Heating taking Bookings?</h2>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>Examples of work we have resumed:
      Bathroom upgrades, cosmetic upgrades, replacement of currently fully operational systems, non urgent maintenance, projects in occupied homes, new bathrooms new en suites, plumbing for projects that do not currently need to commence.
  </p>
  <h2>What you need to do</h2>

  <p>Our engineers can still help you if you have an emergency.
    <strong>You must let us know if you (or your tenants) think you/they could be at risk of Covid-19 or are self-isolating</strong>
    so we can take proper safety precautions to protect both you and our engineers.
  </p>


  <h2>Cancellations</h2>

  <p>We’re operating a policy of no late cancellation fees for Covid related issues.
    <br>
    You will be able to re book later.
  </p>

  <h2>Booking a new job</h2>

  <p>When you book an emergency engineer appointment we’ll ask you if:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>You or anyone in your/the home has been diagnosed with coronavirus.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You or anyone else in your/the home is self-isolating</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Anyone in your/the home is at higher risk – i.e. over 70, respiratory disease, diabetes etc.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Do you think you might have coronavirus? Do any tenants/other residents think they may have coronavirus.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you answer ‘yes’ to any of these questions then we will assess your need for an engineer visit and additional precautions that might be possible</p>

  <p>
    <strong>If your circumstances change between a booking and a job you must contact us.</strong> Our engineer may also call you on the day of your appointment and ask the same set of questions, in case anything has changed since you booked.
  </p>

  <p>When an engineer does visit a customer’s home, they’ll take additional precautions – including hand-washing – before, during and after the appointment. They’ll protect you and your family members by keeping a safe distance at all times – and we ask you to do the same.</p>
